Welcome to my journey of learning React Native and ultimately building a beautiful React native mobile app. Having learned React and Javascript, it gives me an edge while learning this open source framework which is used for building Android and iOS applications. 

What is React Native ?  It is a framework built on top of React for building native apps using Javascript. Developers from Facebook really revolutionized the way the industries are building mobile apps. We don’t need any separate knowledge on iOS or Android development with React Native, since everything is written in Javascript and with the same codebase, the framework lets you build applications for multiple platforms.

How does React Native work? 

JS Thread ---------->  Bridge -------------> Native threads


The framework has the ability to communicate with both sides , JS-based threads and Native app threads with the help of “bridge”. Meaning, the same code that has been used to develop iOS or Android can be utilized to React Native development. Companies these days prefer building their apps using React Native since it cuts the cost of hiring a separate team to maintain iOS codebase and one for Android.

You might be wondering if this framework is just a hype or is it really a game changer. Let me give you a few examples that will make you realize why this technology is here to stay for years to come. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, Ubereats, etc are some of many modern day apps that are based on React Native.

Let me mention some reasons on why this technology is worth using it
Faster development with fewer team members cutting down the cost 
Cross-platform capabilities
Efficiency
Easy transformation of any web project to a mobile app
Less Memory

To sum up, React native is a really powerful tool which is here to stay, so every web developer must have this in their toolbox. Next time, I will come up with how to set up an environment and get it started with the building.
