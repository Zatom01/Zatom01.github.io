My project name was Destination Review. We had to use Javascript on the frontend and Rails on the backend. The concept of backend and frontend became so much clearer after working on this project. Destination Review is for all travellers who wants to check out destination reviews before planning their trip or add a review of their recent destination so that it could help out other travellers. 

To be honest, my Rails project was harder than this project, but this project took more time than Rails project since this was completely different beast. I learned important concepts like DOM, EventDelegations, variable scope, Hoisting, Object Oriented Javascript, contructor, protyping, optimistic vs pessimistic rendering, etc. There are so much to learn about it. Now it all starts to make sense how 'like' feature in modern websites works. I was surprised how quickly the 'likes' feature got updated on the backend, but it could be because my application does not have high volume of traffic, users,etc. For user experience, one thing I can tell is that optimistic rendering is the best since there is no database involved and the updates on the page is lightening fast.

This project reminded me of my Webscraping project. Here, using querySelectors, we have to do deep and get the values just like in we did in Webscraping. For the debugging tool, 'debugger' comes really handy or we can just console log whatever we want to check. It amazing how CRUD operations works using 'fetch' which return a promise. 

Finally, I also learned inorder to make our life easier while using querySelectors to retrieve informations, it is better to give classNames or Ids to specific element. This project has taught me so many things, and will be one of my best projects I have worked. Looking forward for REACT!
