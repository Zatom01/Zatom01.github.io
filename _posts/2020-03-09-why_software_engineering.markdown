I have dreamed many dreams of becoming a professional in a specific field, but none of them gives me the energy to push myself to achieve that like Software Engineering does. I love technology and how our lives actually revolve around it in a big way. Everyday things like cellphones, virtual assistants like Google Home and Alexa fascinates me. I admire the creativity that goes behind all those crazy features of today’s cellphones like Facial detection, Fingerprint Touch ID, Apple Pay, etc. Endless creativity possibility while working in groups and the impact of that product on the global market are the things that drive me to become a Software Engineer.
I am pretty sure everyone has heard of a car dashcam. Its basic function is to record the footage while driving for safety or insurance purposes. I also have one in my car, but it is one step above the regular dashcam. It not only records the front view but also has the rear camera mounted outside which records everything behind me while driving. On top of that, its 10-inch monitor is my rear-view mirror. So, I have a digital rear-view mirror that records front and back that shows my speed with built-in GPS, lane-departure warning, night vision, wide-angle, and whatnot. I’ve had this thing for more than a year and it never fails to make me wonder how the hell someone even came up with these ideas with so many interesting and useful features in a dashcam that I never knew I needed them. I admire the creativity of the team that has led to this product and its impact on people's lives.
Next, I love to work in teams and I strongly believe we can achieve goals together that are unimaginable. I always preferred the group project over individual projects throughout my college life. The number of diverse ideas we get from teammates is crucial in succeeding in any project. For example, for my senior project in college, my teammates came up with this crazy idea which I never thought was possible; building facial and hand gesture models that would control a media player. By the end of the semester, our fantastic teamwork, research, and hours and hours of sleepless nights paid off. Using Machine learning, we were able to train 6 different hand gestures and facial recognition models to control a VLC media player.
To sum up, teamwork and the creativity that complements each other are the driving forces for me to pursue Software Engineering. I want to be part of a team that comes up with simple yet interesting and efficient ideas that will completely revolutionize the way we live and become part of our lives globally for ages to come.
